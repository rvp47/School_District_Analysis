# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The school board found evidence of academic dishonesty for the math and reading grades for Thomas High School ninth graders. The purpose of this analyse is to understand how changing the data to replace nineth graders' math and reading scores affects how Thomas High School performances relative to other schools. This analysis compares the results of a previous school district analysis with unaltered scores to an updated school district analysis with changes to the math and reading scores for the ninth graders at Thoman High School.

The updated analysis includes the following:
- District summary DataFrame
- School summary DataFrame
- Top 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- Bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- Average math score for each grade level from each school
- Average reading score for each grade level from each school
- Scores by school spending per student
- Scores by school size
- Scores by school type

## Results
By making changes in the data, each of the seven school district metrics was affected: istrict summary, school summary, Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools, math and reading scores by grade, scores by school spending, scores by school size, and scores by school type.
